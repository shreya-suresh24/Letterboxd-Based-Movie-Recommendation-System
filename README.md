This project implements a Hybrid Movie Recommendation System that leverages both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system fetches user preferences and movie details from the Letterboxd platform and uses the TMDB API for enriched movie metadata. Designed to enhance user experience, the recommendation engine adapts dynamically based on user interactions, making it a powerful tool for movie enthusiasts seeking tailored viewing suggestions.
